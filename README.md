# Github Explode Bot

Sick of adding a team to a review in Github, then everybody being removed from the PR when once person reviews?

Well be sick no more! Explode Bot individually adds each member of a team to a github PR.

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run typescript
yarn run build

# Run the bot
yarn start
```
